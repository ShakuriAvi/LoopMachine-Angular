# LoopMachine-Angular
The program was implemented in Angular.
There are 9 elements in the program: each element is a song that plays for ten seconds,
under each element there are two buttons: play and stop.
There is also a square that shows whether the power or stop button is pressed.
When the user click on Play button the data on square change to "On".
When the user click on Stop buttons the data on square change to "Off".
In addition, at the bottom of the page, appears all the actions that the user performed in the order of pressing the buttons.
After each click on start buttom the song is played only in the next loop (the next loop happens when all the songs have finished playing in the background together).
When the user presses the stop button the pressed song finishes playing.

# Implementation
At the beginning of the program I read from the Json file all the song names that the program will play.
In addition, the program is responsive to any cell phone / web browser device.
