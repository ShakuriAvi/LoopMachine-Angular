# LoopMachine-Angular
The program was implemented in Angular.</br>
There are 9 elements in the program: each element is a song that plays for ten seconds,</br>
under each element there are two buttons: play and stop.</br>
There is also a square that shows whether the power or stop button is pressed.</br>
When the user click on Play button the data on square change to "On".</br>
When the user click on Stop buttons the data on square change to "Off".</br>
In addition, at the bottom of the page, appears all the actions that the user performed in the order of pressing the buttons.</br>
After each click on start buttom the song is played only in the next loop (the next loop happens when all the songs have finished playing in the background together).</br>
When the user presses the stop button the pressed song finishes playing.</br>

# Implementation
At the beginning of the program I read from the Json file all the song names that the program will play.</br>
In addition, the program is responsive to any cell phone / web browser device. </br>
